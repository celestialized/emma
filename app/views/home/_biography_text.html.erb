<p><b>Gary Vaynerchuk’s Story:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary and his family immigrated to the US from Belarus in 1978. He lived with 8 family members in a studio apartment in Queens, New York, before relocating to Edison, New Jersey. Gary often calls himself a “purebred entrepreneur” having successfully started a lemonade franchise at age 7, and eventually selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of baseball cards and toys throughout his high school career. At 14 he joined his family business bagging ice for $2/hr. When Gary identified “the internet” as a land-grab opportunity in the late 90’s he transitioned his father’s local liquor store (then named “Shoppers Discount Liquors”) into one of the first e-commerce platforms for alcohol in the country resulting in explosive top-line growth. Renaming the business to “<a href="https://winelibrary.com/">Wine Library</a>,” Gary grew his father’s company from $3-60MM in sales during his tenure at Wine Library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time at Wine Library, Gary Vaynerchuk started one of the first long-form episodic video shows on YouTube in 2006 called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WineLibraryTV">WineLibraryTV</a>. Gary produced an episode almost every day for 5 years . Gary’s charisma and uncanny ability to engage with his community landed him appearances on national television with Ellen Degeneres and Conan O’Brien. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After growing his family business through what Gary calls “underpriced attention,” including the impact of content, ecommerce, email marketing, and Google AdWords, Gary began his own journey of producing original business content as the voice of entrepreneurship online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, <a href="https://youtu.be/EhqZ0RU95d4">Gary gave a keynote at Web 2.0</a> in New York City that would ultimately change his career. That speech solidified and was the backbone of Gary’s $1M, 10-book deal with HarperCollins leading to his first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crush-Time-Cash-Your-Passion/dp/0061914177">Crush It!</a> in 2009 which went on to become an international bestseller laying the foundation for his principles on media, marketing, and communication. Soon after, Gary began angel investing in notable companies including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Uber, Snap and Venmo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicating what Gary had done for WineLibrary for other businesses and brands, Vaynerchuk then co-founded&nbsp;<a href="https://vaynermedia.com/">VaynerMedia</a> in 2009 with his younger brother, AJ Vaynerchuk. True to his own DNA, Gary never raised startup funding and began the business in a conference room at Buddy Media. Just 9 years later, the company now includes more than 800 employees, servicing clients such as PepsiCo, GE, Johnson and Johnson, Chase, AbInBev and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VaynerMedia has flourished into having built best-in-class capabilities in paid media, strategy, full-service creative, influencer marketing, IoT &amp; Voice, eCommerce, personal branding, SMB marketing and in-house consulting. In 2017, VaynerMedia entered the publishing space by acquiring premiere women’s magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purewow.com/">PureWow</a> under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallerymediagroup.com/">Gallery Media Group</a> and restructured into&nbsp;<a href="https://vaynerx.com/">VaynerX</a>. In the summer of 2018, the second media brand under the Gallery Media Group umbrella, men’s lifestyle brand&nbsp;<a href="https://www.one37pm.com/">ONE37pm</a> was launched. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to his word, while scaling his business, Gary continued to behave as media company on his own writing 4 more New York Times bestselling business books and becoming one of the most sought after public speakers.. 5 Years in, Gary launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs">#AskGaryVee</a>, a business and advice Q&amp;A show online which later led him to launch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FA-A72QKBw3noWuQbaVXqSD">DailyVee</a>, a full-blown vlog documenting his life as a CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneering the practice of building a personal brand, Gary devised a new content strategy by producing these pillar shows. Today, Gary has more than 12M combined followers across social media, producing content daily on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/garyvee/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/garyvee">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gary">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyvaynerchuk/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/garyvee">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6SZVsPIxPfVs6aavqM1peY">Spotify</a> and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary also hosts a global top 100 business podcast, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-garyvee-audio-experience/id928159684?mt=2">The GaryVee Audio Experience</a>, which features new episodes every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Fall of 2017, Gary announced his first signature sneakers in collaboration with K-Swiss. <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/garyvee-001-002-sneakers/">The GaryVee 001 &amp; 002s</a> were released in November 2017, <a href="https://kswiss.com/pages/gary-vee-clouds-and-dirt">the GaryVee 003s</a> were released in July 2018 &amp; the GaryVee 004s will be released later this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary’s life ambition is the pursuit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITs7KzUPPuQ">buying the New York Jets</a>.</span></p>

                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Vaynerchuk was born in Babruysk, Belarus, in the former USSR. His parents were fortunate enough to find their way to America as part of an exchange program where Soviet Jews were allowed to immigrate to the US in exchange for food aid. While the entire extended family shared a studio apartment in Queens, Gary’s father Sasha began working at a relative’s liquor store in New Jersey and eventually moved the family to Edison, NJ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young child, Gary began his entrepreneurial career by ripping flowers out of his neighbors’ yards and using his natural charm to sell them right back (a profit margin he has still yet to equal). Soon he had upgraded to operating an entire lemonade stand </span><b>franchise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managing multiple locations and commuting via big-wheel to collect his profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his early teens, Gary cornered the local market for baseball cards, often making thousands in a weekend with his keen eye for deals, and his razor-sharp sales-tactics. All of this came to a halt when, at the age of 14, Gary’s father literally dragged him into the family business. In the blink of an eye he went from making thousands of dollars in a weekend to making $2 an hour bagging ice in the basement of Shoppers Discount Liquors, which his father had taken full ownership of by that point.</span></p>

                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Gary realized that people could collect wine in the same way that he collected baseball cards, everything changed. Soon he was sneaking copies of Wine Spectator into class to read up on the latest Bordeaux vintages, and displaying his encyclopedic knowledge on the shop floor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at college (where he went home every weekend to keep working at the store), Gary discovered a brand new invention aweing his dormmates: The internet. He immediately saw the potential to “sell shit” and set about convincing his father to let him have a website built for Shopper’s Discount Liquor. And so, </span><a href="https://winelibrary.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winelibrary.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was born.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the following years, Gary would make it his mission to be a first mover wherever he could see sales opportunities: from email marketing, to Google AdWords to flash sales. This approach dramatically increased sales, driving – the now rebranded – Wine Library from $3MM to $60MM in sales in just five years. Then, in 2006, Gary decided to pursue a new avenue of content marketing, making his foray into creating video content, and changing his life forever…</span></p>

                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, Gary created a YouTube vlog called </span><a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine Library TV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The show featured wine reviews and advice on wine appreciation in Gary’s unique, down-to-earth yet bombastic styler. Episodes consisted of wine tastings along with other wine related topics and were produced at a breakneck speed of one 20-minute episode </span><b>per day</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The show eventually reached cult status, and Gary began to get calls from local news outlets who wanted to interview “The internet wine guy.” This culminated in </span><a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/gary-vaynerchuk-on-late-night-with-conan-obrien/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an appearance on Conan O’Brien</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ultimately launched Gary into the limelight. As the show continued, Gary proceeded to invite guests onto the show with him, beginning with well known wine personalities like </span><a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/2008/10/30/a-wine-tasting-with-jancis-robinson-episode-568/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jancis Robinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and moving onto mainstream celebrities and sports personalities like </span><a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/2009/04/16/wayne-gretzky-visits-wine-library-tv-episode-660/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne Gretzky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

These connections lead to Gary’s first forays into angel investing with early involvement with companies like Twitter, Facebook and, Tumblr. During this time, Gary also embarked on what would become a prolific career as a public speaker, delivering his first ever keynote at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web 2.0 expo in 2008</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the content of which would become the basis for his first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crush It!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). All of this lead Gary to become a fixture at major tech&nbsp;events, including South by Southwest Interactive, where his off-the-grid “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JianJ3SfQaI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret wine party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” became a yearly tradition for those in the know.</span></p>

On it, Gary takes questions from people on Twitter and Instagram, responding to them in his typical unrehearsed, off the cuff manner. Questions are pre-screened by his team, but Gary never hears them ahead of time, ensuring raw, honest answers on everything from marketing, to entrepreneurship, to family, to the NY Jets. The success of the show helped Gary grow his YouTube following to over 130,000 users, and paved the way for follow-on content on sites like Medium, LinkedIn, Inc, and Huffington Post.</span></p>
